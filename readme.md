### Elements of Acccounting

The three major elements of accounting are: Assets, Liabilities, and Capital.

 - **Assets** - Assets refer to resources owned and controlled by the entity as a result of past transactions and events, from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.
    - Cash, Cash in Bank
    - Equipment, Furniture
    - Inventories (assets for sale)
    - Receivables (monies owed to you)
    - Long-term investments
    - Buildings, Land

 - **Liabilities** - Liabilities are economic obligations or payables of the business. Liabilities represent claims by other parties aside from the owners against the assets of a company.
    - Payables (monies you owe)
    - Borrowings - financing arrangements, credit arrangements or loans
    - Tax liabilities

 - **Capital** - Also known as net assets or equity, capital refers to what is left to the owners after all liabilities are settled. Simply stated, capital is equal to total assets minus total liabilities.
    - Initial and additional contributions of owner/s (investments)
    - Withdrawals made by owner/s (dividends for corporations)
    - Income
